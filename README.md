# CRUD operation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The app is made to do CRUD operations on API  [https://api.thomso.in/apiV1/assignment](https://api.thomso.in/apiV1/assignment).
I have used following packages to complete this project.
### axios
### react-router-dom


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
